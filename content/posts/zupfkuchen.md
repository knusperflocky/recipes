## Ingredients

#### Dough

- 300g flour
- 150g sugar
- 200g butter, melted
- 2 eggs
- 40g cocoa powder
- 2 tsp baking powder

#### Filling

- 120g sugar
- 3 eggs
- 500g greek plain yogurt (full fat)
- 250 ml heavy cream
- 1 dash salt
- 2 tsp real vanilla
- 70g butter
- 2 envelopes gelatin 
- 4 tbsp corn starch

## Steps

1. Mix flour, sugar, baking powder and cocoa in a large bowl. 
2. Add melted butter and eggs and knead it thoroughly. Put approx.1/4 of the dough aside (these will become our little 'zupfings', the dough thingies that are added on top of the filling.)
3. Push dough into a 11in spring form and form a base plus sides. (this will be the wall for the filling)
4. For the filling mix softened butter and sugar until creamy, add the eggs and mix for at least 2 minutes or until mixture will become lighter in color. 
5. Add greek yogurt, heavy cream, vanilla, and salt. Mix well. 
6. Fill the cream into the springform. 
7. Now take the remaining dough and tear thumbsize pieces of dough and lay across the top (the 'zupfings' that give that cake its name)
8. Bake at 360 F for one hour.
9. Let cool in fridge completely before removing the outer ring.
