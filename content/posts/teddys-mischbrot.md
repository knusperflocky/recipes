## Ingredients

To prep your sourdough:

1st step: (5 hours resting, 25°C/76°F)
- 25 g sourdough starter
- 25 g water
- 25 g rye flower

2nd step: (12 hours resting, 21°C/71°F)
- 100 g water
- 100 g rye flour

3rd step: (3 hours resting, 35°C/95°F)
- 125 g water
- 125 g rye flour

For the bread:

- 500 g sourdough (from above steps)
- 250 rye flour
- 250 g whole wheat flour
- 250 g wheat flour
- 20 g salt
- 420 g luke warm filtered water

optional:
- 100 g sunflower seeds
- 100 g pumpkin seeds
- 100 g flax seeds

Tools: very sharp non-serrated knife for scoring, spray bottle filled with water, flat bowl filled with water

## Steps

1. The day before make the sourdough. Mix 25g of starter, 25g of water, and 25g of rye flour together, cover and let stand at approximately 25°C for 5 hours.
2. Then add 100g of water and 100g of rye flour, mix, and let stand at approximately 21°C for 12 hours.
1. Then add 125g of water and 125g of rye flour, mix, and let stand at approximately 35°C for 3 hours.
1. From the finished sourdough, reserve 25g as starter for the next time (store in sealed glass jar), using the remaining 500g.
1. Mix the sourdough with the lukewarm water, then add the salt and mix.
1. Mix the flours together slightly, add to the sourdough, and knead with a food processor for about 5 minutes. Cover and let rest for 30 minutes.
1. Knead again, shape, and place in a floured proving basket. Put in a large plastic bag and let rise for about 2 hours, making sure the plastic doesn't touch the dough. 
1. Preheat oven to 250°C (450°F) and prepare a very sharp non-serrated knife in a glass of water and a spray bottle filled with water (for misting). Place a shallow bowl filled with water on the bottom of your oven. 

The next steps have to be executed very fast as the dough starts to collapse quick once dropped onto the baking sheet. 
1. Carefully drop the bread onto a baking mat, quickly score several deep lines into the top, spray with water around the edges and place into oven.
1. After one minute quickly spray with the water bottle several times into the oven (creating steam)
1. Bake on 250°C (480°F) for 10 minutes. Then turn heat down to 220°C (430°F) for another 15 minutes. Finally reduce the heat to 180°C (350°F) and bake for another 35-40 minute (crust will brown).
1. Remove from oven and place on a cooling rack.Place on a floured or parchment-lined baking sheet and score several times.
