## Ingredients

- 1 [cake base - Biskuitboden](/posts/biskuitboden) (or 2 when two-layer cake desired)
- 3 envelopes gelatin
- 250 ml milk
- 125 g sugar
- 500 g Fage greek yogurt
- 2 packets Vanilla sugar (or 2 tbsp vanilla extract)
- 25 ml vanilla paste (Trader Joes)
- 2 tbsp lemon juice
- 450 ml heavy whipping cream
- 2 cans pineapple rings

## Steps

1. Prepare the  [cake base - Biskuitboden](/posts/biskuitboden) and spread out onto parchment paper in a round pattern and bake for 10-12 min (use half of the recipe for one base, full recipe for two rounds)
1. Use a sieve to drain the pineapple rings, collect the juice
1. Activate the gelatine in a small bowl with 100 ml of the pineapple juice. 
1. In a small pot add vanilla, sugar and lemon juice to the pineaple juice and sligtly heat until sugar dissolved. Do not boil, because the liquid needs to cool down again before further processing
1. Add the gelatine gel to the liquid pineapple juice mix.Let it cool down a bit (but not to the point that the gelatine will set, lukewarm is fine)
1. Whip the cream until stiff peaks
1. In another very large bowl blend the yoygurt with the milk
1. Add the pineapple juice mix to the yogurt milk mix and blend until smooth
1. Fold in the whipped cream and set aside.
1. Line a large bowl with shrink wrap. 
1. Place one pineapple ring in the middle of the bottom and arrange several more around it
1. For one layer: Pour then entire mixture of the pineapple rings and place another 5 rings on top. Sink them with a spoon a little bit and place the measured cake round on top.
1. For two layers: Pour half of the mixture on the pineapple rings, add the first cake round, pour the remaining mixture and arrange another 5 or 6 pineapple rings on top. Top with the 2nd cake base
1. Cover with foil and let it set in the fridge overnight or at least for 12 hours to make sure the cream is setting
1. When ready to serve, place on a large enough plate and turn upside down, make sure the foil ends are hanging over the bowl.
1. Carefully wiggle the foil around the bowl until air gets in and the cake will drop

## Notes

- The mixture will be fairly liquid and easy to pour. That is normal
- I have also made this cake without the plastic foil, hohowever, it was a bit harder to get the cake to drop out of the bowl.
