## Ingredients

For the meet:
- 8 thin slices of top round beef (1/4 in thick and roughly 6X10 in in size)
- yellow mustard
- 8 slices bacon
- 8 pickles
- 1 large onion
- salt and pepper

For the gravy:
- 2 tablespoon butter
- 1 tablespoon cooking oil (I use avocado oil because it's ideal for high heat)
- 2 medium yellow onion , chopped
- 3 clove garlic , minced
- 1 small leek , chopped, rinsed and drained in colander
- 2 large carrots , chopped
- 1 large celery stalk , chopped
- 8 large mushrooms, sliced
- 1 bottle cheap red wine
- 2 cups strong beef broth or broth paste
- 1 mini can tomato paste
- 1 bay leaf
- 2 teaspoon sugar
- 1 teaspoon Umami seasoning from Trader Joes
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 4 tablespoons chilled butter
- cornstarch dissolved in a little water for thickening (depending on how much gravy liquid there is you'll need about 1-2 tablespoons of cornstarch dissolved in 2-3 tablespoons of water)
- Optional: 1/2 cup heaving whipping cream


## Steps

1. Lay the beef slices out on a work surface. Spread each beef slices with about 2 teaspoons of mustard and sprinkle with a little salt and freshly ground black pepper.
1. Place a strip of bacon on each beef slice so it's running the same length as the beef. 
1. Place the sliced German pickles and chopped onions on each beef slice. (Alternativly the pickles, onion and bacon can be cubed. I personally like it better in little cubes)1. Roll up the beef slices, tucking in the sides as best you can and securing the beef rolls with [Rouladen-Nadeln](https://www.amazon.de/Rouladennadeln-Edelstahl-Rouladenspie%C3%9Fe-rostfrei-Rouladen/dp/B007CF9AQG), toothpicks or cooking twine.
1. Heat the butter and oil in a heavy Dutch oven, pot or pan (make sure it's oven-safe if baking in the oven) and generously brown the rouladen on all sides. Browning them well will ensure a rich and flavorful gravy. Set the rouladen aside on a plate and leave the browned bits in bottom of pan (important for a flavorful gravy)
1.  Add the onions to the pot and a little more butter or oil if needed. Cook the onions until softened and translucent, about 5 minutes. 
1. Add the garlic and cook for another minute. 
1. Add the leek, carrots and celery and cook for another 5 minutes. 
1. Pour in the red wine, bring to a rapid boil for one minute, reduce the heat to medium and simmer for 2-3 more minutes. 
1. Add the beef broth, tomato paste, bay leaf, sugar, salt and pepper and return the rouladen to the pot.
1. If needed add more liquid as all the rouladen should be covered.
1. Cook on love heat for about 90-120 min (smaller ones need less time) until fork tender.

Gravy:
1. After the 90-120 min remove the rouladen from the pot and set them aside. 
1. Put half of the sauce into a blender (Vitamix is perfect for this) and pulse quickly to puree the chunks and then return back to the gravy.
1. Bring to a simmer and add water/cornstarch mix to thicken the gravy.
1. Optional before serving add a few tablespoons of heavy cream to the sauce. It will give it a very rich flavor.
1. Stir on low heat until thickend and then add the chilled butter with a whisk until fully melted and incorporated.
1.  Add salt, pepper and mustard to taste.

Carefully remove the Rouladennadeln, toothpicks or cooking twine from the rouladen and return them to the gravy and heat through. Serve with Spaetzle, or potato dumplings, or potatoes and red cabbage.
