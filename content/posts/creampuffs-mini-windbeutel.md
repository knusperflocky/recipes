## Ingredients

#### Dough

- 150 g flour
- 125 ml whole milk
- 125 ml water
- 100 g butter
- 1 dash salt
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- piping bag and star tip and a little round tip, 3 mm opening

#### Filling

- For the filling I usually buy baking stable pudding from Germany. I haven't found a good equivalent that pipes well and also stays stable within the pastry without getting runny. I will update the recipe when I have found a good equivalent for the pudding

- 3 envelopes of Dr. Oetker baking stable pudding
[Backfeste Puddingcreme](https://www.germanshop24.com/groceries/german-baking-art/baking-ingredients/dr.-oetker-baking-resistant-pudding-cream/?)
- 750 ml whole milk 

- Whipped cream makes also a great filling for these

## Steps

#### Puffs

1. Melt the butter together with the milk and water in a large enough pot where you can stir comfortably. There is no need to bring it to a boil.
1. Once the butter is melted, turn down the heat to half and quickly stir in all the flour, keep stirring viciously until fully incorporated. It should be one large big lump ball.
1. Remove dough from the pot and put on a larger surface to let it cool down to handwarm temperature.
1. Once the dough is cool enough, place into kitchen aid bowl, and whip in the eggs one at the time.
1. Mix well. -
    Note: The dough should be forming a V like shape when lifting a spoon through.
1. Fill into a piping bag with a star nozzle and pipe either mini eclair shapes or little dollops of max 3 cm diameter 
1. Bake for 18-23 min at 370F until nice and golden and super puffy (no convection fan please or they may collaps, also, do not open the oven or they may also collaps, these are real drama queens in the oven :))
1. Remove from rack onto a cooling wire grate and start preparing the filling.

#### Filling and glaze

1. Prepare pudding according to instructions, or use whipped cream instead
2. Fill into a new piping bag with the small 3mm tip
3. Inspect each puff and find a good place on top or side to insert piping tip and fill with cream or pudding
4. Dip in melted tempered chocolate or paint with sugar glaze (for my neighbor Eric who does not like anything chocolate â™¥)
