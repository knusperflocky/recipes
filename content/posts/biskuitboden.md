| 10 min | 25 min | 1 cake base |

## Ingredients

- 4 eggs
- 120g sugar (can halve if desired)
- 120g flour
- 1tsp baking powder

## Steps

1. Separate eggs from yolks (save both).
2. In a glass or metal bowl, beat the egg whites until stiff peaks form, adding the sugar slowly as you go.
3. Break the egg yolks with a fork, beating them for a couple seconds, and then add them to the egg white mixture, folding them in with a spatula.
4. Mix the flour and baking powder together, and fold those in as well.
5. Add to a greased tortenboden form (cake pan), ideally one of [these](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81OTrISJNuL._AC_SL1500_.jpg).

## Notes

- A plastic bowl will work in a pinch, but it can be harder to get the eggs to become stiff.
