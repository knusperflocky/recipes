| 10 min | 2-3 weeks| 400 g |

## Ingredients

- 250 g blanched almond flour (Costco has the best deal)
- 150 g powdered sugar 
- 4 ½ tbsp (60 ml) water
- 1 ½ tsp almond extract (optional but very recommended)
- 1 tsp rose water food grade (optional)

## Steps

1. Mix the almond flour and powdered sugar in a food processor or kitchen aid with the kneading hook
1. Add the water, almond extract, and rose water (optional) and pulse a couple of times until the dough holds together and forms a ball. If the dough is too dry and doesn't hold together, add a tiny bit more water. Make sure to add just a little until a thick dough is formed. If it's too sticky and wet, add more almond flour.
1. Take out the marzipan ball and knead it on a clean surface for about 30 seconds. You can now shape it into a log, wrap it up in cling wrap and refrigerate it. It will firm up slightly in the refrigerator.
1. Store in fridge for up to 3 weeks
