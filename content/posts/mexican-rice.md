## Ingredients
- 1 3/4 cups + 2 Tbsp warm water or unsalted chicken broth
- 1 medium roma tomato, minced (heaping 1/3 cup)
- 2 1/2 tsp Caldo de Tomate (not vegetarian)
- 1/2 tsp onion powder
- 1/4 tsp chili powder
- 1/4 tsp freshly ground black pepper
- 1 Tbsp olive oil or vegetable oil
- 1 cup uncooked long grain white rice
- 1 large garlic clove, minced 1 1/2 tsp)

## Steps
1. Whisk together warm water, minced tomato, Caldo de Tomate, onion powder, chili powder, and black pepper. Set aside.
2. Heat olive oil in a medium non-stick saucepan over medium heat. Add rice and saute until opaque and lightly golden, about 2 â€“ 3 minutes. Add garlic and saute 30 seconds longer.
3. Pour water mixture in (careful, it will steam and sputter!). Stir once to level out rice (water should simmer right away if not bring it up to a simmer).
4. Reduce heat to low, cover and simmer until liquid has been absorbed, about 20 minutes (you'll notice water bubbles stop coming to the surface).
5. Remove from heat, fluff rice with a fork. Cover with lid and allow to rest 5 minutes off heat. Serve warm.

# Notes
If you want to adapt this recipe to be vegetarian, replace the water with 1.5 cups vegetarian chicken broth (Better Than Bouillon or Ocean's Halo are good picks),
and replace the Caldo de Tomate with 8 oz tomato sauce, 1/2 tsp MSG, and salt to taste.
