> Mexican pulled pork, great in burritos.

## Ingredients
- 4 pounds skinless, boneless pork butt or shoulder
- 3-4 tsp salt
- 1 tsp pepper
- 1 tbsp dried oregon
- 1 tbsp ground cumin
- 1 large brown or white onion, cut into wedges
- 8 cloves garlic, smashed
- 2 limes, juiced
- 2 large oranges, juiced (or 3/4 cup orange juice)
- 3/4 cup Mexican Coca Cola with cane sugar (can substitute chicken stock in a pinch)
- 2 bay leaves

## Steps
1. In the bowl of a 6-quart slow cooker, add pork, salt, pepper, oregano, cumin, onion, garlic, lime juice, orange juice, cola, and bay leaves.
2. Cover and cook on low heat setting for 8-10 hours, or high heat for 5-6 hours (until the meat falls apart).
3. Remove pork and shred with two forks -- do not discard the liquid.
4. Transfer the pork to a baking sheet.
5. Pour 1 ladle full (about 1 cup) of the liquid from the slow cooker over the pork to season. Broil for 5-10 minutes on high heat until the meat becomes golden browned and crispy on the edges.
