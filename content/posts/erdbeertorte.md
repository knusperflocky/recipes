| Prep   | Cook | Serves |

| 1 hr | 10 min | 1 cake |

## Ingredients

- 500g fresh strawberries, washed, de-stemmed, and cut in halves.
- Ingredients for 500mL vanilla pudding (dealers choice recipe, I like 500mL milk + 40g cornstarch + vanilla)
- 1 packet Tortenguss/gelatin

## Steps

1. Go make the [Tortenboden](/posts/biskuitboden) (cake base).
2. Once somewhat cool, prepare the vanilla pudding and pour it into the cake base. Immediately start placing strawberries, cut side down, into the pudding to form a nice pattern.
3. Once all strawberries have been placed, prepare the Tortenguss/gelatin pour. Pour it over the cake, thinly covering the strawberries.
4. (Optional) decorate with whipped cream.
