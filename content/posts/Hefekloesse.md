| 2 hr | 30 min | 10 buns |

## Ingredients

#### Bun dough

- 3 teaspoon active dry yeast
- ¾ cup warm water
- 400 g all-purpose flour
- 50 g sugar
- 200 ml milk
- 30 g butter
- 1 egg
  
## Steps
1. Combine milk with sugar and butter and slowy stir over very low heat (or microwave for 1 min) so that the butter melts and the sugar dissolves.
2. Let cool down to approx 35 Celsius and add one egg. Stir until well combined.
3. Pour into the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a dough hook attachment (you can also just use a regular mixing bowl and knead by hand).
4. Combine flour and yeast and add to the bowl, and turn on 2 or the lowest setting and let it go until a smooth dough ball is formed. Cover with a damp cloth and let it rest for 30 min in the oven with only oven lights on.
5. While the dough is resting, you can make a Vanilla sauce (see Vanilla Sauce recipe) 
6. The dough should have doubled in size. Remove from bowl and drop onto floured surface. Form a long roll and cut into 10 equal pieces.
7. Form round flat balls and lay into steamer with 2 inches space between each dumpling.
8. Let dough rest for another 10-15 minutes in oven with lights on.
9. Put steam on pot with rolling boiling water and let steam for 10 minutes.
10. Serve immediately with fruit jelly and vanilla sauce.
11. Srub the steamer immediately or you will regret it later :)
