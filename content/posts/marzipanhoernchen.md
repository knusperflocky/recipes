| Prep   | Bake | Serves |
| :----: | :----: | :----: |
| 10 min | 15-20 min | 20-24 cookies |

## Ingredients

- 400 g marzipan dough (buy at Fred Meyer or homemade)
- 150 g powdered sugar
- 2 egg whites (ca. 50g) 
- 70 g ground almonds 
- 200 g sliced almonds 
- 200 g tempered chocolade for glazing
- 20 ml Amaretto or Rum

## Steps

1. Cut up the marzipan into small cubes
1. With a kitchen mixer mix powdered sugar, ground almonds, amaretto and egg whites to a smooth (very sticky) dough
1. Let rest in fridge for 15-30 min (easier to form the dough when chilled)
1. Preheat oven to 350F (325 convection) 
1. Put the sliced almonds on a large plate with a rim (to roll the cookies in)
1.  Cut the dough into 40g portions and roll them on the almond filled plate into crecents (easier with slightly wet hands because of super sticky dough). Crecents should be slightly covered in sliced almonds
1. Place on lined baking sheet and bake for 15-20 minutes until golden brown
1. Melt tempered chocolate according to directions in microwave
1. Let "Hörnchen" cool before dipping in melted tempered chocolate
