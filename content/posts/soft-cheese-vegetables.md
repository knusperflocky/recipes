## Ingredients

- 1 bunch asparagus, sliced into 4-6" chunks. Recommend slicing 1" off bottoms and composting.
- 1 jalapeno
- 1/2 lbs mushrooms
- 2 bell peppers, sliced
- Garlic and herb soft spreadable cheese (I like [alouette brand](https://www.alouettecheese.com/products/garlic-herbs-soft-spreadable-cheese))
- Heavy cream
- (Optional) bacon bits (exclude if making vegetarian version)
- (Optional) other veggies you enjoy!

## Steps
1. Wash and chop all veggies
2. Fry veggies in skillet over medium heat. Some take longer than others, I recommend the following order:
  - Asparagus ends (give 2-4 minutes)
  - Bell peppers + asparagus heads (until everything is about 1-2 minutes before being brown)
  - Mushrooms + jalapeno
3. Once all veggies are browned, add the soft cheese along with about 1/4-1/2 cups heavy cream, and stir. If mixture is too thick, add more heavy cream.
4. Serve hot.
