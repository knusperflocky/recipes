## Ingredients

- 1/4 cup popcorn
- 1-2 tbsp popping oil (like canola)
- 1/4 tsp popcorn salt
- 1/2 cup dark brown sugar
- 2 tbsp agave syrup or corn syrup
- 1/2 tsp baking soda

#### Miso style

- 2 tbsp miso paste
- 1 tbsp sriracha
- Splash of vanilla extract
- Garnish with lime zest and ground ginger

#### Jjajang style

- 2 tbsp jjajang base
- 1 tbsp gochujang (optional)
- 1 tbsp light soy sauce
- splash of vanilla
- Garnish with sichuan chili oil

## Steps
1. In a heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat, heat the oil then add the popcorn kernels and salt. Quickly cover the pot and continuously shake while holding the handles until popping stops. Remove from heat and spread popcorn over a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
2. Preheat oven to 250Â°F.
3. In a small saucepan, melt the butter, and whisk in the brown sugar, syrup, and cookable flavoring. Bring to a rolling boil.
4. Remove from heat, and quickly whisk in the non-cookable flavoring, then baking soda (the mixture should turn a creamy color and start bubbling more once the baking soda is added).
5. Moving quickly, pour the caramel over the popcorn and toss to cover all kernels. Place in the oven for 30-60min or until crispy, tossing every 15min.
6. Remove from oven and allow to harden. Sprinkle with zest and enjoy!
