## Ingredients

#### Broth:
- 8 lbs pork bones (neck or femur)
- 0.8 lbs pork fatback/suet

#### Tare:
- 5 3 inch by 3 inch squares of kombu. Shredded kombu or knots will do in a pinch but will be annoying.
- Water to cover (around 1-2 cups)
- ¾ cup dried niboshi (can sub dried anchovies if niboshi not available)
- 1 tbs sesame oil
- 1 cup loosely packed bonito
- ¼ cup sake
- ¼ cup mirin
- 1 cup soy sauce
- Salt to taste

## Steps

#### Broth:

1. Before any cooking, soak the bones in cold water in a large, non-reactive vessel, for at least 6 hours, and up to 24 hours. (I use a large plastic container).
2. The night before you want your broth ready, drain the bones, add them to a pot with fresh water covering them by 2 inches, and bring to a boil over high heat.
3. Drop the heat to medium, and blanch the bones, at a simmer, for 15-30 minutes, or until little to no scum rises.
4. Strain the bones again, and scrub away any black material, such as coagulated blood, from the bones and pot. Don't remove the meat from the bones -- it'll naturally release from the bones after it's done cooking.
5. Return the bones to the pot. Add fresh water, and add in the fatback. If doing the night before, bring this to a boil, then down to the lowest setting on your stove, and cover. Then go to bed. If not, continue to step 7.
6. In the morning, bring the pot back up to a full boil, then back down to the lowest setting possible to maintain that jostling boil while covered. (For me, this is medium on my stove)
7. Depending on when you started cooking, continue to boil the broth for 12-18 hours, or until desired consistency and color is reached, meat has completely separated and broken down in the broth, and fatback pieces have mostly melted. Optionally, you can stir every 1-2 hours just to check up on things and promote more churning. Please feel free to add back water if the level gets too low.
8. Once cooked to your liking, strain the broth, discarding the solids, and reserve broth until needed over low heat. This broth keeps for around a week in the fridge.

#### Tare:

1. Cover the kombu with water enough to cover. Let sit overnight, or at least 3 hours, in the fridge.
2. When ready, add sesame oil to a medium sauce pan over medium heat.
3. When oil is shimmering, toss in the niboshi, sauteeing in the oil for 40 seconds to a minute, or until brown and fragrant. Try not to get this too hot, as bitter flavors might develop if the fish is overheated.
4. Add the kombu and kombu’s soaking liquid. Bring to 176 degrees F.
5. Remove the kombu, add the bonito, and steep the niboshi and bonito in this liquid at 176 for 10 minutes.
6. Strain broth, and reserve while making soy base.
7. In the pot, add in the mirin and sake, and cook at a boil to remove the alcohol, around 5 minutes.
8. Add in the soy sauce, and bring to 176 again. Let sit at this temp for a few minutes to concentrate.
9. Add in an equal part of the fish broth made earlier. Season with salt until quite salty (like, to the point that you’d go “WOW this is almost too salty for me to handle, but damn it’s nice).

## Notes
- The 176 degree requirement isn't strict. I've accidentally gone to 200 and it was fine, just try to keep it between 150-200.
- Get mirin not made with corn syrup. Nice mirin will be made with cane sugar.
- Goes well with [pork chashu](/posts/pork-chashu).
- Need to try caramelizing bones and seeing how it affects flavor.
