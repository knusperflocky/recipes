| 90 min | 30 min | 1 loaf |

## Ingredients

- 80 g butter
- 200 ml milk at room temperature
- 2 eggs
- 500 g flour
- 1 dash salt
- 100 g sugar
- 1 vanilla sugar (or 1 tsp vanilla)
- 3 tsp dry yeast
- coarse sugar to sprinkle (optional)
- raisins (optional)

## Steps

1. In a large bowl, melt the butter in the microwave and mix with the milk and one egg until well blended.
2. If liquid vanilla is used instead of vanilla sugar, add to the butter/milk/egg mix and mix well. 
3. In another bowl mix the dry ingredients (flour, salt, vanilla sugar, dry yest).
4. (If using raisings, add these to the dry mix now).
5. Add the dry ingredients to the butter/milk/egg mix and knead well.
6. Cover with a kitchen towel and let the dough rise in a warm environment (I use the ofen and keep the light on, only)
7. After one hour the dough should have doubled in size.
8. Remove dough from bowl and knead it one more time.
9. Form a long roll, cut in three even pieces and form long strands.
10. Line a baking sheet with a baking mat or parchment paper, and braid the three strands to a nice Zopf.
11. Now blend the other egg with 1 tbsp milk (egg wash) and brush all over the dough. 
12. Let the Zopf rest for another 30 minutes (will make it even fluffier)
13. Bake for 25-30 minutes at 350F. It should have a golden crust.
14. Let it cool on a cookie rack.
