## Ingredients
- [Carnitas](/posts/carnitas) or [carne asada](/posts/carne-asada)
- [Mexican rice](/posts/mexican-rice)
- Tortillas
- Sour cream (Tillamook kind is great)
- Pico de Gallo
- Mexican blend cheese

## Steps
1. Warm tortillas in skillet or in oven, optionally melting cheese on it
2. Assemble and roll up tortilla with filling
3. Place rolled-up burrito back in skillet on the seam, so that it "grills shut"
4. Keep burrito in pan until desired tortilla crispiness is achieved

## Notes
- Oversized tortillas will make the burrito-rolling exponentially easier, but personally I like the taste better with the standard size.
