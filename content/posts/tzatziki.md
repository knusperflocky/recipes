| 30 min | 0 min | 2-3 cups |

## Ingredients

- 1 big cucumber (or two small ones)
- 1 container (454g) full-fat greek yogurt (I like Fage 5%)
- 1 container sour cream (only dairy, no other additives)
- 1 1/2 tbsp garlic powder
- 3 tbsp dried dill
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1 tsp sugar (optional)

## Steps

1. Shred the cucumber into a bowl with the finest setting on a grater.
2. Take the shredded cucumber mixture and strain it through a sieve + cheesecloth (paper towel in a pinch). Try to get as much liquid out as possible. If you like a more watery tzatziki, you can skip this step.
3. In a bowl, combine the greek yogurt and sour cream.
4. Add all the remaining spices.
5. Finally, mix in the cucumber. Adjust spices to taste.

## Notes
- Holds in the fridge at least 2 weeks if in a sealed container.
