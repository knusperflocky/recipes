| :----: | :----: | :----: |
| 15 min | - | 1 container |

## Ingredients

- 1-3 large eggs
- 1 tbsp Dijon mustard
- 2 tbsp red or white vinegar
- 1 tsp sugar or sweetener (optional)
- 1/4 tsp salt 
- 250 ml avocado oil or light olive oil (these have proven to be the most neutral in flavor and healthier than vegetable oils)
- 1 tsp fresh lemon juice (optional)

## Steps

1. This recipe is made the fastest with a food processor or a blender, but a good consistency can be achieved with a whisk. However, to prevent carpal tunnel syndrome I would highly recommend a mixer
2. Add 1 or 2 or 3 eggs to the bowl and mix on high for 1 minute (the more eggs, the yellower the end product will be).
3. Add mustard, salt, vinegar, lemon juice and sugar and mix on high for another 1 minute.
4. With blender on high, super slowly add the oil, first one drop after the other, then in a small stream until a quarter of the oil is in the blender.
5. Adding the oil in tiny drops at the beginning is important so that they oil and the other liquids emulgate.
6. Keep blending on high and slowly add the remaining oil.
7. The mayonnaise should now have its typical texture. It will thicken more when refrigerated.
8. Taste-test it and add more salt or vinegar if needed.
9. Keep in airtight container in fridge for up to 4 weeks.
