| 5 min | 10 min | 2 cups |

## Ingredients

- 1 can (15 ounces) tomato sauce 
- 1 can (6 ounces) tomato paste 
- 1/3 cup apple cider vinegar
- 1/4 cup pure maple syrup
- 1/4 cup molasses
- 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
- 2 teaspoons smoked paprika
- 1 teaspoon dry mustard
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
- 1/8-1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper (to taste)

## Steps

1. In a medium saucepan, stir together all of the ingredients: tomato sauce, tomato paste, apple cider vinegar, maple syrup, molasses, Worcestershire, smoked paprika, dry mustard, garlic, salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper. Bring to a simmer over medium heat.
2. Cover with a lid slightly ajar so that the pot is mostly covered to deter splattering, but steam can still escape and the sauce can reduce. Let cook, stirring occasionally, until the sauce thickens, about 10 to 15 minutes. Taste and adjust seasonings as desired. Enjoy immediately or let cool and store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.

## Notes
- In my experience, holds almost indefinitely in the fridge.
