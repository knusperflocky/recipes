## Ingredients
- 1/4 cup olive oil

- 1 tsp lime zest
- 1/4 cup fresh lime juice
- 1 - 3 canned chipotle peppers, to taste, minced
- 1 Tbsp adobo sauce from can of chipotle peppers
- 1 Tbsp chili powder
- 1 Tbsp ancho chili powder

## Steps
1. Make marinade: In a mixing bowl whisk together olive oil, orange juice, lime zest, lime juice, chipotle pepper, adobo sauce, chili powder, ancho chili powder, garlic, cilantro, cumin, coriander and sugar.
2. Season mixture with salt and pepper to taste (I use about 1 1/2 tsp salt and 1 tsp pepper).
3. Pour half of the mixture into a baking dish just large enough to fit steak, place steak over mixture and press into marinade. Cover top with remaining marinade and spread over to cover.
4. Rest in fridge: Cover dish with plastic wrap, transfer to refrigerator to marinade for 2 - 8 hours.
5. Cook on grill or in skilled until desired doneness (see notes)
6. Slice into strips.
