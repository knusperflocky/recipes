## Ingredients

- 
- 6

## Steps

1. Mix baking soda, salt and flour. Set aside.
2. Peel and mush the bananas and add a few squirtz of lemon juice (prevents them from browning)
3. Add the egg, coconut oil and the yogurt and mix well. 
4. Now add the brown sugar and vanilla and mix well.
5. Finally add the walnuts and flour blend.
6. Blend in the chocolate chips and fill into a well oiled loaf form.
7. Bake for 50-60 minutes at 350F and test with a wooden skewer. If skewer comes out dry, bread is ready.
8. Let cool for a bit and remove from form and let cool on wire rack.
