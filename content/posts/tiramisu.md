| 45 min | 3+ hr | 9 x 13 pan |

## Ingredients

- 500 ml strong coffee or espresso (I used TJ's instant coffee), cold
- 100 ml Amaretto or Hazelnut Liquor or Rum 
- 6 packets sweetener (I use purevia) (or 30g sugar)
- 2 eggs (separated)
- 1 dash salt
- 1 lbs mascarpone (room temperature)
- 450 ml heavy cream
- 4 packs lady fingers (12 in each pack)
- cocoa for dusting
- 4 tbsp vanilla

## Steps

1. First whip the egg whites with a dash of salt until it creates stiff peaks.
2. Add the sweetener (or sugar) to the heavy cream and whip until stiff
3. Mix the egg yolks with with vanilla until it gets lighter in color
4. Add the mascarpone to the egg yolk mixture and mix until well blended
5. Now fold in the whipped cream and the whipped egg whites
6. Mix Amaretto (or other liqours) with the coffee and fill into small container (for dipping)
7. Dip one ladyfinger at the time for 3-4 seconds in coffee/schnaps liquid, make sure it was fully immersed
8. Layer the bottom of the form with half the lady fingers
9. Spread half of the cream on top and sprinkle with cocoa
10. Repeat for second layer and dust with cocoa (if prepared the night before, add the cocoa before servering to avoid bleading into the cream, just for looks :) )
11. Refrigerate for at least 2-3 hours before serving and use within 2 days
